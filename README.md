## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the Election Audit was to determine how many total ballots were cast and how many votes each candidate received. Additionally, the election audit also asked us to determine how many votes were cast in each county and which county casted the most votes.

## Election-Audit Results
There were a total of 369,711 total ballots cast in this election. Diana easily blew away her other competitors and captured 73.8% of all votes that have been counted. Most of the ballots that were cast could be found in the densely urban county of Denver with just short of 83% of all total ballots cast in this election happening in the Denver precinct.  

The counties with the most amount of votes casted were the following in sequential order:

1. Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
2. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
3. Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

The candidates with the most amount of votes were the following in sequential order:

1. Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
2. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
3. Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Given the results of this election, both Mr. Charles Casper Stockham and Mr. Raymon Anthony Doane conceded early last night to Ms. Diana DeGette. Both were highly congratulatory of her campaign and wished her best wishes. Neither of the losing candidates are likely to contest the election nor blame voter fraud for the end results. 

## Election-Audit Summary
This script could easily be used for any local or national election. Many national news outlets use data on how many ballots were cast to forecast election day results. Additionally, both GOP Strategists and Democratic Strategists use data like this to infer which counties political candidates should focus their campaign on. 

This script could be modified in the future to look at a larger list of counties and districts. Additionally, with modules such as seaborne, you could also easily create visuals to help strengthen the results of this analysis.
